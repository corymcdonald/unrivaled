# Unrivaled Bracket application

A caveat is that this is a quick, hacky project that was developed within 24 hours. Some of the coding style, of approaches were not ideal.

## Key things I have done

- Created a recursive bracket entry model using Rails as a backend
- Designed the [primary bracket user interface](app/javascript/bracket.jsx) in React.
- Created a [quick reporting](app/models/bracket_entry.rb) method to determine the top predicted winners of the entire championship.
- Defined a [Player model](app/models/player.rb) with database-based eligibily to allow for players who dropped out the day before the challenge started
- Marketed the bracket entry on Social Media (BlueSky) and had over 5000 brackets created by users. 
- Leveraged photoshop to create transparent player images based on the Unrivaled site
